# Social Media Backend Application using FASTAPI Python Framework with relation DB (Postgres)

Contains:
- Authentication and Authorization
- CRUD Endpoints for POSTs
- CRUD Endpoints for Users
- 'Like'/'Vote' System


### Note: This was built for educational purposes. To help a friend learn Frontend, so we needed a functional Backend for a full working experience (and refresh my Python skills).
#### If anyone copies the code, do update the packages before going forward with the app
